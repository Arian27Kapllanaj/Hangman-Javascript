## 1. What Hangman Game is?
### Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## 2. How does this game works?
### You can press Start button and the hidden word will show. You have 6 attemps to find the hidden word. If you have not found the hidden word within 6 attemps, a pop-up message will come and say to you that you have lost. If you will find the hidden word, a pop-up message will show and say to you that you have won. If you want to start the game again just press the Start button. You can also pres Start button in the middle of the game and the game will start over.

## 3. What code or framework I have used?
### This is my first ever project, I have used HTML, CSS, Javascripts and Bootstrap framework. This project was my first experience using bootstrap framework and also mastering Javascript.

## 4. Why there are 2 verions of this game(master/WIthout API)?
### Master branch or version shows the hidden word by using an API, but sometimes the API does not work so you can use the other verions called "WIthout API".
